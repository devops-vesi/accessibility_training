![NVDA Logo](./webapp/images/nvda_logo.png)

## ⚙️ Preliminary – Install NVDA

Before configuring NVDA, ensure it is installed on your device.

🔗 **Download NVDA:** [https://www.nvaccess.org/download/](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)

✅ **Installation steps:**

1. Download the setup file (e.g. `nvda_2025.1.2.exe`).
2. Run the downloaded file. Music plays while a temporary copy of NVDA loads. NVDA will speak throughout the process.
3. The NVDA Launcher window appears with the license agreement. Press **Down Arrow** to read it.
4. Press **Tab** to move to the “I agree” checkbox, then press **Spacebar** to check it.
5. Press **Tab** to move through options, then press **Enter** on the desired option.
6. If you do not have admin rights: select **“Create portable copy”**.  
   This allows NVDA to be set up in any folder without installing, useful on computers without admin rights or on a memory stick to carry with you. NVDA will guide you through creating the portable copy – the main input is the destination folder.

2. Click **General** in the left panel

### 🔧 5. Enable Speech Viewer

✅ **How to enable it:**

1. Right-click NVDA icon → **Tools → Speech Viewer**
